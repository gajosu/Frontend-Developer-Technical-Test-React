# Frontend Developer Technical Test - React

## Objective
Your task is to create a simple React component that fetches, displays, edits, and deletes a list of todos from the JSONPlaceholder API.

## Requirements

1. **Fetch Todos:**
   - Use the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch todos. API Endpoint: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`
   - You can use native fetch API, Axios, or any other HTTP client you are comfortable with.
   - API Documentation: [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/)

2. **Display Todos:**
   - Render the fetched todos in a list. Each list item should display the todo's title and completion status.
   - Ensure the list is readable and user-friendly.

3. **Edit and Delete Todos:**
   - Implement functionality to edit the title of a todo.
   - Add a feature to delete a todo from the list.
   - Note: Since JSONPlaceholder API does not support persistent changes, simulate these actions in the front end.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement basic error handling for the API request.

5. **Code Organization:**
   - Structure your code in a clean and logical manner.
   - Include comments where necessary to explain your logic.
